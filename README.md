### Objective

### Story

You are the leader of a small team of warriors. You got a message that your town is in danger from the horde of Orcs. You have to be there in 2 days. If you take the safe road you will there in 7 days. That is too long and your town will be lost. The only chance to make it on time is to pass through the dangerous **Dark Forest**. It will be difficult but you and your brave warriors might have a chance.
